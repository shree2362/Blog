This is the first time since January 2019 that three Indian players have featured so highly in the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asia Cup 2023: Full Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gill\'s rise in the rankings is a result of scoring 58 runs in a 121-run opening partnership with India captain Rohit Sharma. Meanwhile, Rohit and Virat Kohli also gained two ranks each and now occupy eighth and ninth positions respectively. Rohit\'s rise was facilitated by a half-century against Sri Lanka, while Kohli\'s ranking increased thanks to his unbroken 122 against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gill has been brilliant in 2023 and could become the first batter to hit 1000 runs in this calender year. Gill has scored 904 runs in 16 matches at an average of 64.51, while striking at 105.31. Gill was the leading run-scorer in IPL 2023, while winning the ICC Player of the Month award in January. He also became the youngest player to hit a double hundred in the 50-over game earlier this year, when he scored 206 runs against New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Rohit, he has now scored three back-to-back half-centuries in the ongoing 2023 Asia Cup. Meanwhile, Kohli smashed his 47th ODI century against Pakistan and is just two centuries behind Sachin Tendulkar\'s (49) record for the most hundreds in the 50-over format.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three India batters, namely, Rohit, Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan were in the top 10 more than four years ago. They were also among the top six of the batting table in September 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pakistan also has three cricketers in the top 10, just ahead of the ICC Men&rsquo;s Cricket World Cup. Captain Babar Azam is seated at the top spot, more than 100 rating points ahead of Gill, while Imam-ul-Haq and Fakhar Zaman are fifth and tenth respectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new rankings also consider players\' performances in other international series. South Africa&rsquo;s Temba Bavuma has moved up 21 spots to 11th position after highly successful performances in his last eight ODIs. Other players making notable progress include Australians David Warner and Travis Head, alongside India stars KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2023-09-13 18:02:15'),

This year too, the company has introduced four models - iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and a Pro Max version. There is no Ultra variant, which the leaks have been suggesting. From the USB-C port to Dynamic Island, Apple has made key changes to the design part of the new iPhones. Both standard and Pro models have received massive upgrades in terms of hardware as well. Here is a look at the specs, price, design and other details of the newly launched iPhone 15 series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 15: Price revealed at Apple event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the India price will be revealed in a few hours, the company has revealed that the price for the US market will start from $799. The India price will also be the same as last year\'s model. Similarly, the company has just increased the price of the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the standard iPhone 15 Pro will cost the same as the old model in the US. This means that the Pro is priced at $999, whereas the Pro Max will cost you $1,199. The devices will go on sale in the US on September 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the prices for the Pro models have been hiked in the Indian market. In India, the price starts from Rs 1,34,900 for the iPhone 15 Pro model and the Pro Max will cost Rs 1,59,900. The iPhone 15 is priced at Rs 79,900 in India for the 128GB storage model and the Plus model will be on sale at Rs 89,900.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro models: Design changes announced at Apple event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 15 series has retained the old design. You will still see the same boxy design with a dual camera arrangement at the back. One of the biggest changes in the design is the addition of a USB Type C port at the bottom. Apple has finally dropped its Lightning port in iPhones, and so now people don\'t have to carry a different charger for their iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another notable change that Apple has announced is the addition of a punch-hole display design on the front. Apple first introduced punch-hole displays with the launch of the iPhone 14 Pro models last year. Many were disappointed that the same feature didn\'t make it to the standard models, but this has now changed. All the new iPhone 15 models now have Dynamic Island feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has also replaced the mute switch button with a new Action Button. With this, users can quickly access shortcuts, access accessibility features, launch the camera, activate the flashlight, and perform a range of other tasks. While its default function remains as a ringer switch, it offers the potential for users to unlock a multitude of additional functionalities, making it a versatile tool you\'ll want to utilize for more than just adjusting your phone\'s ringer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will be available in new colors - Pink, yellow, green, blue, and black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 15: Specs revealed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 15 continues to offer a compact form factor and sports a 6.1-inch liquid Retina display similar to the iPhone 14 and all the previous iPhone models. The Plus model also retained the 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 15 has received a major upgrade in the camera department. The standard and the Plus model offer a 48-megapixel primary camera sensor, which is a massive upgrade over the 12-megapixel dual camera system seen on last year\'s model. This hardware is identical to what was introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro last year, complete with a fresh telephoto feature integrated into the Camera app. There are a new night mode, Smart HDR mode and other camera modes for better photography experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users will also be able to record 4K videos. Apple says the new portrait mode offers enhanced bokeh effects, quicker shutter speeds, and more convenient access. One will also be able to take advantage of focus and depth control options within portrait mode for even greater creative control. At the rear, the secondary sensor is a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera boasting an f/1.6 aperture and sensor shift stabilization. Additionally, the new standard models feature a 12-megapixel TrueDepth front-facing camera for high-quality selfies and Face ID capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2023-09-13 18:21:19'),

Broader markets, especially the Nifty SmallCap 100, registered a strong rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-weightage sectoral indices such as Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services ended in positive territory after registering a strong comeback during the trading session. Nifty PSU Bank rose over 4.23 per cent today, as shares of public lenders such as PNB, IOB, Central Bank and PSB gained sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Nifty PSU Bank hit a 52-week high, Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd, said, &ldquo;The Nifty PSU Bank index has broken out to multi-year highs, gaining more than 10 per cent in September alone. The chart pattern suggests that this is just the beginning of a rally, but intermediate corrections cannot be ruled out.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Investors can add the top three PSU banks, State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda (BoB), and Punjab National Bank (PNB), to their portfolios. They can also allocate a small portion of their portfolio to smaller PSU banks, as these stocks are high-beta and have the potential to generate higher returns,&rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The 4,600-4,450 range has become a strong support zone for the Nifty PSU Bank index. If the index sustains above this level, it could move up to the 5,800-6,000 range,&rdquo; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 5 gainers on the Nifty 50 were Coal India, Grasim, Tata Consumer Products, Bharti Airtel and Titan. On the other hand, the top losers were HDFC Life, M&amp;amp;M, Adani Ports, L&amp;amp;T and Cipla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, investors are likely to track US inflation data as it will provide insights into the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s policy review later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deven Mehata, research analyst at Choice Broking, said, &quot;Following a flat opening, the Nifty continued higher and closed above 20,000 for the first time. Nifty has a strong support near 19,900-19,950 levels. Traders should hold the long position in Nifty with a stop loss of 19,900 levels. If Nifty closes below the mentioned support, we can witness further profit booking. If Nifty crosses 20,110 levels, it can move higher towards 20,200-20,250 levels and above.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2023-09-13 18:06:31'),

Apart from Kohli and Rohit, Wellalage also dismissed the likes of Hardik Pandya, Shubman Gill, and KL Rahul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For me, Virat Kohli is the No. 1 batsman. I am very happy to have got those two (Kohli and Rohit) big wickets. I trust my basics, and trust myself,&quot; Wellalage said in the post-match press meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20-year-old said he was trying to bowl a wicket-to-wicket line against star Indian batters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The batters were set and India had got off to a fabulous start. I just tried to bowl wicket to wicket. Once we got those three wickets in three overs, we were able to put India under pressure. There was a turn and when you put the ball in the right area, you could unsettle the batsmen. But I would have been happier with a win,&quot; Wellalage added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite limiting India to 213, Sri Lanka could only manage 172, losing by 41 runs. Later, Wellalage made an impression with the bat as well, scoring 42 runs off 46 balls. The left-handed batter shared a 63-run stand for the seventh wicket with Dhananjaya de Silva, reviving Sri Lanka\'s chances of victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I just tried to support him. We didn&rsquo;t want to take any risks. His plan was to try and get closer to India&rsquo;s total,&rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka will face Pakistan in a virtual knockout match, with the winner advancing to a title match against India on September 17.&lt;br&gt;Wellalage hoped his team could reach the final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have played four matches so far and we are happy that we have won three of them.
